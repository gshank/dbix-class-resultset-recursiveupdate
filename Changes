Revision history for DBIx::Class::ResultSet::RecursiveUpdate

{{ $NEXT }}
    - Fix missing Test::Exception test dependency
    - Get rid of discard_changes for each created row
      To further reduce the number of queries. This required to remove support
      for populating a column used by a has_many relationship by a related row.
    - Reduce select queries for has_many relationships where the foreign key
      column and the relationship is named the same and the related row is
      specified as a hashref containing the foreign column
    - Don't execute select queries for any relationships of created rows
      because no related rows can already exist

0.40      2019-10-29 14:16:34+01:00 Europe/Vienna
    - Fix missing Try::Tiny dependency
    - Don't try to find a row by primary key if not all primary key columns are
      defined
    - Reduce select queries for has_many relationships
      to one per non-prefetched or none for prefetched has_many relationships
      down from one per related row even for prefetched relationships
    - Don't execute a delete/update query for has_many relationships if no
      rows need to be deleted or unlinked by setting their foreign key
      column(s) to NULL
    - Preserve prefetched related resultsets on row update
    - Stable update order by sorting all columns and relationships

0.34      2014-02-06 23:37:32 America/New_York
    - More changes to support custom CODE relationship condition

0.33      2014-02-06 14:58:54 America/New_York
    - Don't die on custom CODE relationship condition

0.32      2014-01-20 19:15:29+01:00 Europe/Vienna
    - 'id' can't be used any more as an alias for the primary key column name
      as DBIx::Class doesn't treat it special
    - Try to construct a new row object with all given update attributes and
      use it to find the row in the database

0.31 Wed Nov 6, 2013
    - Fixed failing test when DBIC_TRACE_PROFILE is set
    - Fix problem with join_type LEFT and undef (rt67528)
    - discard_changes before handling post_updates

0.30  Fri Jun 7, 2013
    - Update foreign key instead of related object when all PKs are set on a
      relationship with accessor single or filter

0.29 Thu May 2, 2013
    - Remove DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS dependency

0.28  Wed Apr 3, 2013
    - Don't delete and re-add all many-to-many rows. Transform m2m data to
      recursive has_many data if IntrospectableM2M is loaded.

0.27  Tues Feb 26, 2013
    - Do an update on the object when there are 'other_updates' in addition
      to when the row 'is_changed' because of possible custom update methods

0.26  Wed Nov 28, 2012
    - Fix multi-pk has_many bug
    - Fix has_many with where conditions

0.25  Thu Apr 12, 2012
    - Suppress DBIC warnings: NULL/undef values supplied for requested
      unique constraint 'primary'.

0.24      2011-05-16 15:34:10 America/New_York
    - Fixed test case that was failing on newer versions of DBIC, which
      is more strict when inspecting relationship join conditions.  You
      will need this when you want to upgrade DBIC.

0.23      2011-02-24 18:23:50 Europe/Vienna
    - Fixed moosified-rs.t failures by making the test skip if not all
      dependencies are met. Requiring Moose for a compatability test would
      have been overkill. (thanks CPANTesters & RT#65959)

0.22      2011-02-09 19:06:34 Europe/Vienna
    - Fixed updating of nullable has_many rels (RT#65561)
    - Fixed usage with moosified resultsets (RT#64773)

0.21      2010-10-28 16:56:18 Europe/Vienna
    - Warn instead of throwing an exception if a key is neither
      a column, a relationship nor a many-to-many helper.
    - More documentation improvements

0.20      2010-10-19 09:25:33 Europe/Vienna
