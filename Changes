    - Do an update on the object when there are 'other_updates' in addition

0.24 2011-05-16 15:34:10 America/New_York
    - Fixed test case that was failing on newer versions of DBIC, which
      is more strict when inspecting relationship join conditions.  You
      will need this when you want to upgrade DBIC.

0.23 2011-02-24 18:23:50 Europe/Vienna
    - Fixed moosified-rs.t failures by making the test skip if not all
      dependencies are met. Requiring Moose for a compatability test would
      have been overkill. (thanks CPANTesters & RT#65959)
