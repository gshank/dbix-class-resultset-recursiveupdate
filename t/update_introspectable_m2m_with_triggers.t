# Note:
#
# I am using DebugObject in t/lib to catch the DBIC debug output
# and regexes to check the messages in order to find out what RU
# really did.
#
# I think that this is a bad Idea. If the queries produced by
# DBIC change in the future, these tests might fail even though
# DBIC and RU still behave the same.
#
# I currently have no better idea how to find out weather RU
# called set_$rel for M2Ms or not.
# (It shouldn't if IntrospectableM2M is in use)
#
# I prefered this solution over monkeypatching DBIC, which was my
# second idea. Any hints are highly welcome!
